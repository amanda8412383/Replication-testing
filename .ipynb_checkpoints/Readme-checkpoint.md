This respiratory gathers part of the course assignments and toy projects I have done, it is connected to Travis CI to ensure the reproductivity of all files inside.

###  <span style="color:orange">**phd_econometrics_HW**:</span> 
containing 4 programming assignments I did for Ph.D. courses econometrics2 in Uni Bonn.
    
   - **problem set 1:** dataset estimation & using Monte Carlo simulation to examine the efficiency of IV and OLS estimator in the given setting.

   - **problem set 2:** Monte Carlo simulation of strictly stationary setting

   - **problem set 3:** simulate censored data and estimate with 2 steps estimator and probit model

   - **problem set 4:** comparing GMM estimation using identity matrix and optimal weight matrix in the given setting, then doing overidentification test

###  <span style="color:aqua">**macro Octave model simulation improve**:</span> 
including 7 ipynb showing simulation of variation of the Ramsey model in macroeconomics from simplified to complicated ones. Rewriting the course content is to assist my understanding of the model and enhancing the automaticity. Sympy is greatly used to recreate the process of doing derivatives in class. In the last problem set, I introduce ipywidget to make it interactive.
